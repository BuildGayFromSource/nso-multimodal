    Is the influencer life glamorous? When looking from the outside, many people might say absolutely. Having lots of fans and attention is the dream life for many young Americans, which is why 54% of them would be an influencer if given a chance. As such an aspirational job, it would be exceedingly difficult to convince people that such a job might not be simply fame and fortune - especially an extremely online generation. This is where Needy Streamer Overload steps in; the new media concepts variability and cultural transcoding help explain the intents and design of our humble game.

    When people think of video games, they typically think of more obviously interactive experiences like Mario, Call of Duty, or similar. This makes Needy Streamer Overload stand out, because visual novels are typically associated with linearity rather than full interactivity. This assumption is broken upon beginning the game, as you are greeted with a user interface that looks incredibly like Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
    You hear a direct message ping from someone, asking you to log into their streaming account. This assistance (and thus, interactivity) forms the crux of Needy Streamer Overload - you are both an assistant and partner to the protagonist Ame and her streaming persona OMGKawaiiAngel (or KAngel for short).

    After the prologue day, the operating system fully opens to the user, showing a variety of activities to do with Ame, and additionally making the player aware of four different statistics: Follower Count, Stress, Affection, and Mental Darkness. (Figure B, Mental Darkness not pictured.) Manipulating these stats through different activities affects her mood, responses, and can lead her and the player into different endings to her story.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first day sets a baseline of both game knowledge and cultural knowledge for the player. The intention of the game is to show the player how and why being an influencer or streamer is not always rosy. Taking Ame to a shrink or Shibuya will raise her affection towards the player and lower her darkness, but it takes two out of three time slots... slots you could have used to generate new streaming ideas or even the act of streaming itself! You could choose a different activity to avoid that, such as browsing /st/ or name-searching herself on Tweeter, but those tend to raise her anxiety and darkness in turn.

    <p>
    The primary purpose of the game is to immerse the player into the theoretical life of a streamer. Of course, directing Ame is an expression of variability – she shifts from her actions. This is not atypical, many if not most video games embody variability. In fact, von Gillern crafted a framework and diagram illustrating this variability connection. Players offer decisions to the game, and the game responds (albeit in predictable ways) in a multimodal fashion. However, visual novels are a comparatively simpler vehicle for this type of message due to needing fewer specific literacies to both understand and enjoy. 
    </p>
    <p>
    As mentioned before, the developers created the user interface (UI) to resemble the Windows operating system. Windows has 70 percent of desktop market share (Statistica) – it is likely that someone is comfortable with the UI and thus can easily understand and interact with the game without extra knowledge. I believe that this simplicity does not take away from the intentions of the game, as there are still written explanations, abstract symbols, and numerical representations of mechanics and dialogue. 
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, take another look at Figure A and B. The login button in Figure A has an exclamation point next to the icon. Clicking it and logging in not only begins the game, but also begins a stream. This associates the icon with streaming, and in the future moving your cursor over an activity with the icon shows a pop-up with Ame telling the player they will have a new streaming idea when performing that activity. Von Gillern writes that “… [players] were able to understand the meanings of abstract systems, which enhanced their understanding of the games’ syntax and influenced their decision-making processes.”

    However, an integral part of this experience is the cultural transcoding of streaming (and Virtual Youtubing) culture to these players. While they are likely to have the literacies necessary to read and interact with NSO, how does the game immerse players in the life of a streamer?
    </p>
    <p>
    As stated before, multiple activities replicate a real-world activity – Tweeter is X (formerly Twitter) and /st/ is based off the 4channel board /vt/ (Virtual Youtubers), down to even the specific behaviors of imageboard users. Streaming and virtual streaming is tied to a certain balance of authenticity and distance from their viewers to avoid the creation of parasocial relationships. This problem is quickly exacerbated if the streamer is female, as 90 percent of livestream viewers are male (Sjöblom), and female streamers and content creators who “self-sexualize” (Tran). This problem asserts itself in NSO both in Ame’s streams and her interactions in social media (Figure C).
    </p>
    <p>
    In fact, during streams, you function as a moderator for her. You can select certain chat messages for her to interact with and delete hostile or trolling messages – doing so slightly improves her anxiety. However, the improvement is intentionally minimal compared to the stress that streaming intrinsically brings.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is rhetorically convenient that this is the case – streaming is difficult and stressful work, and it takes a toll on the streamer. It is exceedingly likely that the player cannot perfectly manage Ame during the first few attempts at the game, and will inevitably find Ame and themselves in a bad ending (Figure D) that parodies behaviors and situations that streamers and Virtual Youtubers have found themselves in. Unfortunately, few of them are good, and some bring physical harm to Ame.

    <p>
    Needy Streamer Overload is a specifically crafted game meant to both parody and warn of the harms and worries of streaming culture. Players direct Ame on her journey to obtain a million followers and will fail a few times, both slowly opening to the player through variability and showing the players how streaming culture harms nearly everyone involved with cultural transcoding. It is easy to interface with due to the familiar user interface, allowing a variety of people to both interact with the game and thus learn just how harrowing the influencer life can be.
